                <h2>Effects of the Atmosphere on Geosphere
</h2>

                
                <h3>1. Weathering and Erosion </h3>
                <p>The elements’ physical and chemical processes needed to break up and move rocks and debris away (weathering and erosion) are provided by the atmosphere.  
</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Physical/Mechanical Weathering: Rock changes expand and contract to crack in response to the temperature change in the atmosphere. Wind erodes the surface physically — it blows up tiny bits of rock against exposed surface material, especially on dry land — called wind erosion. This is where the sand dunes first develop, in terms of wind erosion.  
</li>

                    <li>Chemical Weathering: Atmospheric gases dissolve into a slow, gradual acid in water, a part of the hydrosphere. So with example when rainwater’s CO2 (carbon dioxide) dissolves, it gives H2CO3 (carbonic acid), as an acid, and it reacts with some minerals in rocks (e.g. limestone), which are also in the rocks (it turns over) which gets broken down into small pieces of minerals. 8 Doing so is important for making soil.  
</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Extreme Weather Impacts 

</h3>
<p>The geosphere can change rapidly and furiously in response to heavy atmospheric influence:  
</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tornadoes and Hurricanes: These are caused by violent acceleration of the path caused by large forces like the strong winds and precipitation that are attached to them; they can induce landslides, slumps, and coastal erosion by exerting force.  
</li>
                </ul>
               
            </div>

            <div class="section-box">
                <h2>Impacts of The Geosphere on Circulation of Atmospheric System  
</h2>

                <h3>1. Volcanic Activity
</h3>
                <p>Volcanism and Earth’s slow carbon cycle also dramatically influence the composition of Earth’s atmosphere. From volcanism to the pumping of CO2, the planet’s atmosphere changes in massive, deep ways to transform its geological setting. Volcanoes are vehicles by which gaseous and particulate gases propel from the inside of a planet to the atmosphere.  
</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Short-term cooling: Volcanoes spew massive amounts of sulfur dioxide and ash into the stratosphere. The SO2 then creates very reflective sulfuric acid aerosols. The aerosols deflect incoming solar radiation from the planet, causing it to cool down for a little while but not too much: Like Mount Pinatubo when it burst into a fiery explosion.  
</li>
                    <li>Long-term warming: Volcanoes also emit significant amounts of CO2 and water vapor into the atmosphere. It is not frequently as large in size as emissions done by humans, but is part of what is happening in the atmosphere: a natural greenhouse effect that lasts a lifetime and affects everything which surrounds it in the long term.  
</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>2. The Earth’s Plate Tectonics and Climate: 
</h3>
<p>For millions of years, the earth’s plates are pulled apart by movement.  
</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Removal of CO2: As CO2 in the atmosphere is produced in a chemically-driven process (weathering silicate rocks with CO2 from the atmosphere or atmospheric CO2 as carbonic acid), carbon is trapped and is absorbed as the gas moves down the Earth’s seafloor and its presence is enough to remove the gas completely and effectively.  
</li>
                    <li>CO2 Release: A huge amount of all these buried rocks is melted due to subduction and volcanism to be brought back to the atmosphere and thus completes the slow geological cycle. Which is mainly why, in the end, plate movement can influence how fast material is cleared along with it due to the mountains which can contribute to the climate eventually.  
</li>
                    <li>Uplift of Range: When top mountain ranges all over the world reach their peak, there is a geological phenomenon associated with changes in global wind movement -- movements of the atmospheric circulation through them; a global climate change affects local climate at a local level.</li>
