            <h1>Interactions between Geosphere and Biosphere</h1>
            

            <div class="section-box">
                <h2>Geosphere's impact on the biosphere.
</h2>
                <p> Soils, rocks and landforms (Geosphere) are the important physical and chemical infrastructure for all life irrespective of their land and sea state. The geosphere is characterized by the absence of inhospitable environments or faults that produce any kind of microorganisms. 
</p>
                
                <h3>1. Provision of Habitat and Minerals
</h3>
<p> Giving a habitat and minerals. Solid Earth makes physical space and the basic resources that form the base for living things and provides the major resources needed to sustain them. 
</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Terrestrial Home Base: It’s this continent land where life on continents — deserts and forests — lives. Soil — a combination of ancient rock and decomposed organic material — contains plants and sustains nearly every land-based food chain. 
</li>
                    <li>Important nutrients: As rocks age through weathering, they release minerals like phosphorus, potassium and iron that are crucial parts of our body’s metabolism in the soil and water. These minerals are absorbed by plants and as a consequence, the food chain suffers. 
</li>
<li>Ocean Floor Vents: Specific geological features on the deep ocean floor release heat and minerals, supporting unique ecosystems of organisms that rely on these chemicals, rather than sunlight, for energy.
</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Catastrophic Events and Land Creation
</h3>
<p>Sudden geological events can dramatically reset and reshape the environment for the biosphere.
</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Volcanic: Large eruptions can wipe out native habitats as lava flows and ashfall kill them quickly. Nevertheless, volcanic ash changes rapidly to high-potency soil over much longer periods. In the long run the volcanic ash is also very fertile, as is evident in all island chains and other areas. 
</li>
                    <li>Earthquakes and Landslides: Ground shaking can eliminate habitats, redirect rivers, and set in motion devastating landslides that instantly wipe out forests and populations. And Tsunamis—created by underwater earthquakes—can devastate coastal ecosystems. 
</li>
<li>Mountain Buildings: Slowly, mountain ranges rise up resulting in numerous high altitudes, which provide climatic oscillations and help in the evolution of specialised species suited to these habitats. 
</li>
                </ul>
                
            </div>

            <div class="section-box">
                <h2>Impact of the Biosphere on Geosphere. 
</h2>
                <p>The Biosphere (living organisms) actively influences the stability, composition, and physical breakdown of the Geosphere (rock and soil).
</p>
                
                <h3>1. Soil Formation and Weathering. Life is the prime producer and producer of the earth’s soil, layer upon layer. 
</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Biological Weathering: Both physical and chemical damage to rock is achieved through plants, lichens, fungi, bacteria and fungi. Fractured glass roots on the plants swell, breaking rock apart. In addition to serving as food, they produce natural acids that dissolve the minerals present in rocks – and the rest of the process. Soil – When organisms have died their remains rot and merge with the bits left from ancient rocks in the soil to form what is now humus. 
</li>
                    <li>Creation of soil: its water- and nutrient-holding capacity increases and it becomes more amenable to plant growth.
</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Landscape Stability and Mineral Storage
</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Erosion Control: The huge network of trees and grass provides a convenient mechanism for soil particles to hold it all together. With all the thousands of varieties of vegetation (trees, grasses and herbs), the result is that ecosystems can contain even vast expanses of soil—one can easily trap them and make water, fish, soil particles. That way the soil mass will be saved from being badly exploited by wind and flooding that would simply wash away the ground. 
</li>
                    <li>Fossil Fuels and Rock Deposition: the body parts of dead plants and marine life buried in the earth’s crust (Geosphere) for millions of years. This intense heat and pressure create geological deposits of material that have become fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas, as well as massive sheets of limestone rock. This locks carbon and other elements from the biosphere into the geosphere.</li>
