            <h1>Interactions between Hydrosphere and Geosphere</h1>
            

            <div class="section-box">
                <h2>Impact of Hydrosphere on Geosphere.
</h2>
                <p>The main environmental influence with respect to Geosphere (Earth-rock, rock, landforms) is the hydrosphere, the water in liquid, ice, and vapor. 
</p>
                
                <h3>1. Erosion and Weathering. 
</h3>
<p>The main environmental influence with respect to Geosphere (Earth-rock, rock, landforms) is the hydrosphere, the water in liquid, ice, and vapor. 
</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Water and Ice: Run water down rivers, streams and coasts, scraping rock and sediment, or collecting sediment or soil. Water seeps into the rock cracks and freezes and expands when it gets colder (ice wedging) and crushes the rock into pieces. Glaciers (large stretches of icy material) rub out rock beds beneath them, cleaving valleys and fjords alike. 
</li>
                    <li>Mineral and water-induced weathering by weathering: The mineral plus water (as well as the watery, acid-soluble atmospheric carbon dioxide released by rainwater) makes it react with other minerals in rocks (think limestone) This reaction breaks down rock material, changing its quality and causing it to weather. This dissolution is partly responsible for the formation of caves, and also for the continual enrichment of water with dissolved solids. This is the building of landforms around sediment settling. Water slows down and it drops, thus the matter it conveys goes out and new types of land develop. Building sediment formations — rivers deposit sediment in the mouth, which form deltas. 
</li>
                    <li>Coastlines are nourished by sea lapping and coastal tides: sand is nourished, which creates beaches and spits. Slowly, over the course of thousands or tens of thousands of years, successive deposits of mud, sand and mineral precipitates sink down to sea floor, settle at the bottom of a lake bed and solidify into solid, compacted forms of sedimentary rock such as shale, sandstone, and limestone eventually. The form of Hydrosphere is thus taken as formed in the Geosphere (solid-rock, landform). There it assumes a shape, its motion and distribution. 
</li>

                <h2>Impact of Geosphere on Hydrosphere.
</h2>
                
                <h3>1. The topography and water distribution. 
</h3>
<p>It is only among this structure of land that the flowing and living water will happen. 
</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Drainage systems and basins: the mountains, hills, and valleys inside the geosphere structure set the direction of flow of all surface water in watersheds. River water goes across banks and downwards because the hill itself or slope of the hill determines the direction of flow. 
</li>
                    <li> Groundwater reservoir (aquifer): The water is contained in soil and permeable rock strata from the earth in aquifers and aquifer zones below ground (for example, porous sandstone and solid granite types of rock), and location, large and small aquifers are the principal water-flow systems providing groundwater. 
</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Chemical input & sea salinity. 
</h3>
<p>Water is continuously moving through the Geosphere, always existing on a day by day basis, and interacting with the Geosphere where it influences its chemical makeup. 
</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mineral and Salt Inputs: The precipitation that moves through land and other surface water from ground rocks is known to dissolve the minerals and salts in those rocks through weathering. It also plays a major role in the presence or dissipation of salts in the form of the chemical makeup of the rock. But these dissolved solids are ultimately transported into rivers and oceans, and in that water eventually sinks into the minerals and the ocean began to get salty with the dissolved solids. 
</li>
                    <li>Deep sea hydrothermal vents: In volcanic zones on the ocean floor (a territory located within the Geosphere), when seawater seeps into the cracks it is heated by molten rock on Earth and the big minerals dissolve. The superheated water, then high in minerals, is vented in for continuous ventilation to the ocean and, accordingly, helps with ocean chemistry.</li>
